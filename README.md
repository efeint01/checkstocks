## Lessons Learned

I created this project with the goal of creating a stock market app for Android. The app's interface is designed similarly to that of an iOS stock app. I faced challenges when using the MPAndroidChart library due to the many variables involved. With the help of ChatGPT, I was able to design the app professionally. If you're looking to create a similar app, ensure you have a backend in place. I had many ideas for the app, such as adding stock news, but most APIs were paid, and free ones had a limited number of requests per day. I also faced issues with being banned from the Nasdaq API while debugging, but the ban only lasted five minutes.
